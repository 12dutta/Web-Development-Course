1. Array
2. Object
3. Function

Object:- it is a collection of key value pairs.
syntax -
         let obj = {
            name: "vaibhav",
            age: 22
            line of code
         };
         console.log(obj);

Stack & Heap memory allocation:-
Stack : Stack memory is used for storing local variables with primitive data types such as int, string, bool, etc. The size of stack memory is typically fixed and limited, determined at compile time.

Heap : Heap memory is a more flexible and dynamic memory space used for dynamic memory allocation. Heap memory is used for storing reference datatypes such as objects, arrays. Heap memory can grow dynamically during program execution, and its size is usually much larger than the stack.

Shallow Copy VS Deep Copy

Array:- it is a collection of items/elements.
syntax -
        let arr [1,2,3,4,5];
Build-in Methods
      - push -> insert at end
      - pop -> remove from last
      - shift -> remove first item form leftmost
      - unshift -> add first item from leftmost
      - slice -> new part nikalte hai
      - splice -> array ke content ko change kar sakte hai (insert, remove, replace) kissi bhi jagah pe
      - map
      - filter
      - reduce
      - sort
      - index of
      - find
