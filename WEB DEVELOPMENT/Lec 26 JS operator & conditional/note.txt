                                                 OPERATORS AND CONDITIONALS

 Unary Operator:-  ++ Pre increment,   -- Post decrement
  pre incr me phele value increment hogi fir value print hogi
  post incr me phele value print hogi fir increment hoga
  let c = 4;
  console.log(c++);   
same with post & pre decrement --

Assignment Operator:- =,  +=,  -=,  *=,  /=
  let a = 2;
  a = a + 10;  same as  a += 10;  O/P-> 12
  a = a - 10;  same as  a -= 10;  O/P-> 8
  a = a * 10;  same as  a *= 10;  O/P-> 20
  a = a / 10;  same as  a /= 10;  O/P-> 5


Comparison Operator:-  <,  >,  ==,  >=,  <=,  !=,  ===,  !==
there o/p is always in True or False.

Strict Equality v/s Loose Equality
  - Strict equality is denoted by '==='. When we use strict equality operator, both the data-type and the value are checked to determine equality, and it returns a boolean answer.
  - Loose equality is denoted by '=='. When we use loose equality operator, only the value is checked to determine equality, and it returns a boolean answer.

Ternary operator:- (Conditional operator)
 three part hote hai- condition, statement, to execute if the condition is true and the statement to execute if the condition is false.
 Syntax-> (condition) ? (statement1) : (statement2);
